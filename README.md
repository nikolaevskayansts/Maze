#### This game has a mechanism responsible for the random appearance of text and sounds within the radius of the player and thus creating the feeling of a chaotic transparent cage from which it is impossible to get out.

#### It was created in the first month after russian invasion of Ukraine and motivated by personal feelings about it and first of all I wanted to demonstrate a disorder of the mind that fill the space of words and ideas.

#### The work was done in Russian and I don't consider it necessary to adapt/translate it into other languages because the issue was a pretty narrow (???). In a nutshell this space consists of a set of random ultimatum statements, including quotes from the Bible or the press, as well as statements from high officials and popular streamers
